# YAIM904 d02b – Armors with Immunity 🛡️

---

## 📦 Description

**YAIM904 d02b – Armors with Immunity** adds new special armors to Factorio that grant the player **damage immunities**.

This MOD introduces:

* 🛡️ **One armor per damage type**, each making you completely immune to that specific damage
* 🧿 **One ultimate armor** that makes you immune to **all damage types**

The goal of this MOD is to give players more control over survivability, especially in late-game scenarios, testing setups, or creative playstyles.

## ⚙️ How it works (Player view)

* Each armor can be crafted and equipped like a normal armor
* When worn, the armor **nullifies incoming damage** of its assigned type
* The ultimate armor blocks **all damage**, effectively making the player invulnerable

No configuration or scripting is required from the player.
